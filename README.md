## Project Background
Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), played a central role in the housing finance system leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. The crisis, triggered by widespread defaults on subprime mortgages, exposed significant weaknesses in the U.S. housing market and the broader financial system. As a result, Fannie Mae required government intervention and underwent significant reforms aimed at improving its risk management, capital reserves, and overall financial stability.

In the years following the crisis, Fannie Mae strengthened its operations through various initiatives. These included improving credit risk management, increasing transparency, and adopting more conservative underwriting standards. The institution also worked closely with regulators to implement reforms designed to prevent future instability.

By the time the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2019, Fannie Mae was in a stronger position. It had increased its financial resilience by building up capital reserves and creating mechanisms to support homeowners and renters during periods of economic uncertainty. The organization’s ability to respond swiftly during the pandemic—through loan forbearance programs and other relief measures—was a testament to the lessons learned from the 2008 crisis.

In this project, I will explore the changes that Fannie Mae implemented following the 2008 financial crisis to better prepare for the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data visualization techniques, I will analyze key reforms and their impact on the institution’s financial health and resilience during the pandemic.
